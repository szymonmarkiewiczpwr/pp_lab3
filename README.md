## General Description

This project was developed as part of a university assignment (Task 3) to explore and benchmark different parallelization techniques for matrix multiplication in C#. The application provides a graphical interface to compare the performance of two parallel implementations:​

- Parallel.For: Utilizes the Task Parallel Library (TPL) to distribute computations across multiple threads efficiently.​
- Manual Threading: Employs explicit thread management to parallelize the matrix multiplication process.​

By executing matrix multiplications using both methods, the application measures and displays the execution times, facilitating a direct comparison of their performance characteristics.​


## Features

- Matrix Multiplication Implementations: Includes two distinct parallel approaches for matrix multiplication.​
- Benchmarking: Measures and compares the execution times of the two implementations.​
- Graphical User Interface: Provides a user-friendly WinForms interface to input matrix sizes, initiate computations, and view results.​
